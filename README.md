Project Quiz Game in Python


I am building a Quiz Game in Python using simple if-else conditions and input() functions. The game starts with a greeting message, asks the player if they want to play, and then runs multiple choice questions one by one. For every correct answer, the score increases by 1, and at the end, the final score is displayed.

So far, I have written 15 questions in total. 

Currently, the project is 90% completed. The quiz works bolo perfectly with if-else logic, options (A, B, C, D), and score tracking.

Next Steps / Improvements: I am going to add random so that out 15 it will give 5  shuffle questions  every time
